			"blurb": "I was introduced to Joey by the interior designer to paint and do a couple of tile installations. Joey and I connected on a lot of levels and the requests to take the house in a whole new direction got bigger and bolder with every visit. I'm a rare fit for this. I might be one of a few GC's with a theater degree and a desire to work creatively on this level. My role became almost equal parts general contractor and art curator. Ann introduced some incredible talent to the project: Mishka, graphic designer, Aaron, muralist, and Evan, neon and sheetmetal artist and I had the pleasure of finding other talent: Jim, stained glass, Dan, water features, Pyrology, bronze sculpture and Stuart, stone sculptor, Craig and Teena, front door, to name a few. I loved bringing good people to this project because it was a rare one for all of us. We were empowered at every turn with great creative license and I feel that really got us excited. I always try to engender the care in every craftsman. To have a client that was so fully supportive of everyone's work was really amazing. Joey could not have been more excited about the work and that inspired everyone to their best.     What this experience has meant to me...  I believe it's taught me, as a young business owner, that the right clients are out there. I might only ever get to work with one Joey, but it has been encouraging to me to know that my specific skillset and my desire to blend art and construction, has a place. It has been a honor and pleasure to be tasked with finding artists and craftsman to translate visions into reality.  It has been rewarding to take great care in ensuring that all of the elements come together beautifully and to know that the client is rooting for us throughout the process.  As I write this, I can't help but think about how much more is still to be done! :)   I have also personally learned a lot from Joey's disposition.  He always has something positive to say. His enthusiasm is contagious and he doesn't sweat the small stuff. The only time he got mad (so he claims) was when we locked him out of the house. I never saw him mad because he chose to take a drive and came back smiling (to an unlocked house, thank goodness). He also really seems to enjoy people. He loved talking to Aaron while he was painting the mural. He's met and talked with all of the artists on the project.  He and Evan went guitar shopping. He's always glad to see Leo, our painter on site. All of this reminds me to take the time to visit with people, and to choose to see the good in the world. Those are pretty incredible lessons to take away from a client in the middle of a home renovation. ",

			"blurb": "During our first meetings with Joey, he expressed a strong desire to create a house that would be a gathering place for his family, neighbors, and the community. However, the original form of the spec house was closed, even hostile towards the street. I had a hunch that landscaping and a standard re-paint wouldn't be the cure needed. Assembling the team of builders, designers, and craftspeople to collaborate on the transformation of the house from spec to an underwater fantasy was great fun! Each new person brought onto the team caught the infectious joy of the project! We all could feel the FUN and WONDER radiating from the house onto the street to every passerby.",

Getting to know Joey, someone I can consider a friend now, has been an experience all on its own. His 'down for anything' attitude and laid back nature made this experience truly a pleasure. There were no boundaries with him when it came to a creative idea to take this house to the next level.   When Joey contacted Rain Lily for a consultation and I walked through his brand new spec home that felt practically sterile, I had no idea what this project would evolve into and that we would end up working together for almost two years. I know there is more to come, can't wait for phase 3 and beyond!",

It was easy to visualize the water features under the giant blue octopus and a view of the creek. We had the opportunity to use unique materials, so we tucked quartz crystals and moss into the waterfalls and even added a giant floating quartz as a focal point to the backyard stream! It was amazing to connect not only to the space, but as water artisans with other artists and craftspeople.",
