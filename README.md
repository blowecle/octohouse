Welcome to the Octopus House, hosted at www.octopushouse.com

This is my first professional project after graduating from Fullstack Academy and was built using the following tech stack:
frontend:
reactjs, redux thunk, (coming soon, nextjs refactor)

backend:
express, sequelize, postgresql

While this may seem like overkill for what could be a static website, the customer specifically requested that I engineer a dynamic fullstack application where he could update the database on his own.  I ran a team of 4 people:  myself, Evan Farias (graphic design), James Ruiz(photography), and Perry Hall(photography).
